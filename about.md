I am a friendly, proactive, honest and ambitious graduate who seeks a bright future in the world of work through determination, perseverance and integrity. With my previous experience in a variety of workplaces, I have equipped myself with a set of skills to allow me to contribute to new challenges I will eventually encounter in my future career. My biggest strengths are optimism and perception, as I always seek the bright side of what I will encounter in the future, and every challenge will bring forth my full potential resulting in strengthening soft skills, confidence, and my ability to keep learning new things which will contribute to my personal development.
