I will be posting here about projects I have worked on or working on with date, repository attached below.

## BMI Calculator (01/09/2020 - On-Going)

I am currently working on this project, feel free to view the repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/ans-github/BMI-Calculator-Test).
## Cafe Group Project (01/10/2020 - 23/11/2020)
Private Project (Group)

This is a private group project which is why it is not viewable however I felt I should list this as I have learnt about AWS (amazon web services) the features included and agile scrum methodology to complete the project.
## Brew App (01/09/2020 - 08/09/2020)

This was my first developing project that provided me a huge insight into developing using the Python language.
You can visit the repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/ans-github/Brew_App).
