## Cafe Group Project (01/10/2020 - 23/11/2020)
----
####Private Project (Group) - Completed.

What have I learnt from this project?
*Agile Scrum Methodology
*ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process
*AWS (Amazon Web Services) features (Cloudwatch, S3 Bucket, Lambda Function, Data Pipeline)
*Soft Skills (Teamwork, Perserverance, Communication)
*Technical Skills (SQL, Python)

This is a private group project which is why it is not viewable however I felt I should list this because of the course I had taken with GenerationUK.

## Brew App (01/09/2020 - 01/10/2020)
----
This was my first project that provided me a huge insight into developing using the Python language.
