## Cafe Group Project (01/10/2020 - 23/11/2020)

Private Project (Group) - Completed.

What have I learnt from this project?

 -Agile Scrum Methodology

 -ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process

 -AWS (Amazon Web Services) features (Cloudwatch, S3 Bucket, Lambda Function, Data Pipeline)

 -Soft Skills (Teamwork, Perserverance, Communication)

 -Technical Skills (SQL, Python)

 -I have been exposed to new softwares such as snowflake, docker, postman, and VSCode.

This is a private group project which is why it is not viewable however I felt I should list this because of the course I had taken with GenerationUK.
